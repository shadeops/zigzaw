# zigzaw
Zigzaw Solver

Build with Zig 0.10.0 and repo includes a vendored raylib.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/shadeops/zigzaw.git
cd zigzaw
zig build run
```

There are some basic keyboard controls.

- Up / Down Arrow speeds up/down the FPS and thus solve speed.
- Spacebar pauses the solve.
- R resets the board and randomly shuffles the pieces to place.
